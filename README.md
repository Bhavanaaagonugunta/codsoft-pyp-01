A to-do list is a tool for organizing tasks that need to be completed. It typically includes:

- **Tasks**: Specific actions that need to be done.
- **Priorities**: Levels of urgency or importance.
- **Deadlines**: Due dates for tasks.
- **Categories**: Grouping tasks by type (e.g., Work, Personal).
- **Status Indicators**: Marking tasks as "In Progress" or "Completed."
  
To-do lists help improve productivity, reduce stress, and manage time more effectively. They can be made on paper or using digital apps like Todoist or Microsoft To Do.
